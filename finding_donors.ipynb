    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    " The best model from the above evaluation is the Adaboost Classifier. The F-score on this model is slightly higher than the Random Forest Classifier. The prediction time and training time are higher than the other models due to the complexity of the algorithm. The model prediction time is close to 0.11 and the model training time is 2.15. The model prediction time also decreases as the we increase the size of the dataset. Adaboost combines weak learners to gives us the best model. It protects against overfitting and since the dataset has a large number of categorical variables, Adboost will likely classify fewer outliers."

    "Adaboost improves the overall performance of a model by weighing the previously misclassified points with higher weights.In Adaboost we combine weak learners to form a strong learner. The weak learner is a learner model that has an error rate less than 1/2. The model is not completely accurate, the relationship between the input and target will be weak and poor.The first learner is modelled and the misclassified points are made bigger and weights are assigned to them. The weights are assigned such that the weights of the total correct and incorrect points are the same. This process is continued by creating new learners, the process can be stopped with any number of learner models. The weight of each model is calculated if a learner model has zero it is useless. If the model is negative, then the prediction is the opposite of the model result. Adaboost checks the weight of each model and takes that weight to be the model vote. The model weights are added, the negative weights are subtracted in a combined model. The areas which are positive indicate that the prediction is true and areas that are negative indicate that the prediction is false. Thus Adaboost uses optimally weighted majority vote to combine weak learners. Adaboost also allows us to import weak learner models."

    "The five features I believe to be most important are education level, occupation, hours per week, capital_gain and age. I would rank in the order of occupation, education_level, age, hours per week, capital gain. The reason I rank I feautures in this order is because the first feature occupation has a direct effect on the income, a better occupation can increase a person's income by atleast $10,000. I believe the second feature income directly influences occupation and income. A person's education level may also increase a person's occupation level with higher education levels leading to better incomes. While a person's income is also greatly benefitted by a rise in education level. I believe the third important feature is age. A persons income increases with age with most companies offering a bonus after a few years of employment and its likely that a persons income reaches its peak at the end of their career. The hours worked per week can increase or decrease income, part time jobs generally have fewer hours per week leading to low income levels. Overtime hours can also significanly raise income levels. I believe the final important feature to be capital-gain, a persons capital-gain is a direct estimate of income, higher capital gains are possible only with higher income levels. This is because a person is likely to buy properties of higher value with higher income and capital gain increases with sale of a higher valued property."

    "Based on AdaBoost, the most important feature for our model is capital-loss. This feature was not in my list. I believe that capital-loss refers to decrease in value of an asset or real estate. I am not sure how capital loss has a relationship with income, of the other variables only education_num is not present in my list. I believe that education_num is derived from education level and occupation so the two variables are correlated. The order of priority of variables is different from my list. Looking at the visualization above, age has a direct impact on income, it is likely that everyone with a job is likely to get a higher pay with age. Since this is certain, it is ranked higher than other variables. Capital gain is possible only with higher income. So the capital gain value would be directly related to the income level. Hours per week likely depends on age and capital gain. People between 25 to 45 are most certain to work longer hours, but hours per week does not have complete linear relationship with income.Also higher capital gains might mean that the person likely has higher hours per week. Finally education num is derived from education level and occupation, the reason for it being last in the list is probably due to the data.People within a education level or occupation have higher and lower incomes but it is possible that people across education and occupations have relatively close income levels. It is also because income variable is divided into two categories and this might cause less variation in income based on education_num."
